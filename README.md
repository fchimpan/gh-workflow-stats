## Installation

You can install it using the gh cli extension.

```
gh extensions install fchimpan/gh-workflow-stats
```

## Quick Start

If you want to get the success rate and execution time of a workflow:

```sh
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml
```

If you want to get the success rate and execution time of a workflow job in JSON format:

```sh
$ gh workflow-stats jobs -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --json
```

If you want to debug issues or see detailed operation logs:

```sh
# With verbose logging
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --verbose

# With debug logging
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --debug
```

## Usage

```sh
$ gh workflow-stats -h
Get workflow runs stats. Retrieve the success rate and execution time of workflows.

Usage:
  workflow-stats [flags]
  workflow-stats [command]

Examples:
$ gh workflow-stats --org $OWNER --repo $REPO -f ci.yaml

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command

  -v, --verbose                 Enable verbose logging (info level)

Use "workflow-stats [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Fetch workflow ID

For the `--id` flag, you can list the workflow IDs with the standard `gh` CLI: `gh workflow list`, e.g.:
```
NAME                             STATE   ID
AAAA                             active  123456
BBBB                             active  543112
```

### Fetch all workflow runs

By default, `workflow-stats` and `workflow-stats jobs` commands will return **100** workflow runs.
If you want to get all workflow runs, you can use the `--all` flag.
However, GitHub API has a rate limit, so please combine other parameters as appropriate to reduce the number of API requests.

```sh
# Get executed at 2022-01-01 or later and actor is $ACTOR
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml -A -c ">2024-01-01" -a $ACTOR
```

More details on API rate limits can be found in the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

### Debug and Logging

You can control the level of logging output using debug flags:

```sh
# Normal mode - clean output with no logs
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml

# Verbose mode - show informational logs to stderr
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --verbose

# Debug mode - show detailed debug logs to stderr
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --debug
```

**Note**: Logs are always output to stderr to avoid interfering with the main output. When using `--json` flag, logs are automatically disabled to ensure clean JSON output.

### GitHub Enterprise Server

If you want to use GitHub Enterprise Server, you can use the `--host` flag or set the `GH_HOST` environment variable.
Host name is `http(s)://[your-github-host]/api/v3/`

```sh
$ export GH_HOST="your-github-host"
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml
# or
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --host="your-github-host"
```

### How it works
This tool retrieves workflow execution statistics using the GitHub API. For more details on the parameters, please refer to the GitHub API reference.
- [Workflow runs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-workflow-runs-for-a-workflow)
- [Workflow jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-jobs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-job-for-a-workflow-run)

## Rate Limiting

GitHub imposes a [primary rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-primary-rate-limits) and a [secondary rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-secondary-rate-limits) on all API clients.

When you reach the primary rate limit, results are calculated based on successful fetches.
In the secondary rate limit, this tool handles requests in a round-tripper to avoid the rate limit. Therefore, the execution time may be longer.

For large repositories with many workflow runs, consider using filtering options (`--created`, `--actor`, `--branch`, etc.) to reduce the dataset size.

## Standard Output

[Sample output](./sample/std-output.txt)

### üèÉ Total runs

`Total runs` is the total number of workflow runs that `status` is `completed`. It includes `success`, `failure`, and `others` outcomes. `Others` outcomes include `cancelled`, `skipped`, etc.

**`Total runs` includes the results of attempts other than the latest.**
This means that for a workflow that succeeds on the third attempt, the results of the first and second workflow executions are also included in the calculation.

### ‚è∞ Workflow run execution time stats

`Workflow run execution time stats` is the average execution time of workflows with **`success` conclusion and `completed` status**.

### üìà Top 3 jobs with the highest failure counts (failure runs / total runs)

`Top 3 jobs with the highest failure counts` is the top 3 jobs with the highest failure counts. It is **not** failure rate.
Instead of using the success rate, the tool displays jobs based on the number of failures, as jobs with fewer executions but a high failure rate would otherwise be ranked higher.

 The number of jobs displayed can be changed with a command-line argument `-n`.


### üìä Top 3 jobs with the longest execution average duration

`Top 3 jobs with the longest execution average duration` is the top 3 jobs with the longest execution average duration.

The number of jobs displayed can be changed with a command-line argument `-n`.

## JSON Schema Overview

If you use `--json` flag, the output will be a JSON object with the following structure. You can see sample output in [json-output.json](./sample/json-output.json).
